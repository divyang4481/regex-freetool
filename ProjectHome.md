## The purpose of this tool is the testing and creation of Regular Expressions while: ##

  * Testing regular expressions using the .Net Framework.
  * Providing a very easy to use and clean interface.
  * Being very responsive to user actions by updating the test results on every keystroke.
  * Providing an interface that accelerates the experienced developer towards the solution quickly.

This tool is different than others, because it is NOT a syntax creator, it focuses on being a very efficient environment for testing and modification of Regex's. It also attempts to show the full impact of the Regex's programmatic implementation by helping the user to easily reference specific Groups or Captures in code.
